        <h1>Graphic Design</h1>
        <p>
          One of the most important factors of any website or application is how
          visually appealing it is to the viewers. The Graphic Design industry
          has become a crucial part of the IT industry, both growing with
          demand. As technology keeps growing and expanding, competition is
          growing between companies. This is creating more demand in the Graphic
          Design and creating more job opportunities for those who are
          interested.
        </p>

        <h2>My Motivation</h2>
        <p>
          My favorite part of this internship has been getting to design how the
          elements look on a webpage. The placement, the color palettes, and
          what images look best with the decided upon visuals have all been a
          delight for me. I've enjoyed finding color palettes for years and have
          contemplated joining the Graphic Design industry multiple times in the
          past. Knowing now that it ties into the IT industry adds another draw
          to the idea.

        <h1>How SnapIT has Motivated Me</h1>
        <p>
          SnapIT started out as a motivation to learn code in the first place
          which has only grown as I've learned throughout the past 7 weeks.
          In addition, SnapIT has encouraged me to explore the world of coding and
          the designs it can create. From different Unicodes, dozens of ways to
          code to get the same result, and the fun add-ons that can be added
          onto any page, I've gotten to explore and see them because of SnapIT.
          I hope that I can learn more and use my experience with SnapIT as a
          stepping stone for the future.

        <h1>My Next Experience</h1>
        <p>
          I plan to learn more about making a website or application more
          visually appealing. This includes animation, transitions, and color
          manipulation. I'm also going to be helping my dad with several HTML
          databases and learning how to manage the programming for those and the
          results they create.
